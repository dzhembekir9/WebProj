        <h2>What is sports supplement?</h2>
        <p class="text">Sport supplement is a manufactured product intended to supplement the diet when taken 
            by mouth as a pill, capsule, tablet, or liquid. A supplement can provide nutrients either 
            extracted from food sources or synthetic, individually or in combination, in order to increase 
            the quantity of their consumption. The class of nutrient compounds includes vitamins, minerals, 
            fiber, fatty acids and amino acids. Dietary supplements can also contain substances that have 
            not been confirmed as being essential to life, but are marketed as having a beneficial biological 
            effect, such as plant pigments or polyphenols. Animals can also be a source of supplement 
            ingredients, as for example collagen from chickens or fish.

        <h2>Capsules</h2>
        <p class="text">You are probably all too familiar with capsule supplements. In capsule supplements, the two 
            outer ‘shells’ are made from either gelatin or starch and are made to fit together to hold dry 
            ingredients. The way the two outer shells of capsules are suited together prevents oil-based 
            ingredients and liquids from going into a capsule. Gelatin capsules are typically made from bovine or porcine 
            skin and bones but have now been diversified to include chicken, fish, and even vegetable form, 
            making them viable for strict vegetarians.Capsules are convenient. They can be quickly taken and 
            typically break down in about 20 minutes inside the stomach. They can also be combined with 
            other capsules and can be tossed into your bag to grab whenever you need them, but many 
            people find them difficult to swallow.

        <h2>Tablets</h2>
        <p class="text">In addition to the active ingredients, a large number of excipients 
            (which are essentially inactive substances that serve as the vehicle or medium to 
            form a supplement) are added to tablets to allow them to compress and then disintegrate 
            when ingested. There are typically more excipients in tablets than in capsules, which can 
            lead to digestive discomfort. Typical excipient ingredients in tablets include xanthan gum 
            and microcrystalline cellulose.

        <h2>Softgels</h2>
        <P class="text">
            Softgels, which are also called gelcaps, are typically used for oil or liquid-based supplements. 
            Most people find them easier to swallow than capsules or tablets. This is because the main 
            non-active ingredient in gel caps is a soft layer of gelatin on the outside of the active 
            ingredient(s). The gelatin is typically from a cow or pig source, but it can be fish-based 
            or vegetable-based. (Though vegetarian softgels are not widely used.) When compared to tablets 
            and capsules, gel caps often contain fewer non-nutritive excipients. They are also completely 
            sealed, more stable, and tend to carry a longer shelf life when compared to liquid and capsule 
            forms (keep in mind this largely depends on the contents).

        <h2>Powders</h2>
        <P class="text">Powdered supplements that are mixed with liquids (such as water, coconut water, or almond milk) 
            are an excellent choice for people that have trouble swallowing pills or have conditions that 
            reduce their ability to digest foods. They’re also a good choice for nutrients like protein or 
            collagen, which are soluble, have little taste, and can be easily mixed into a smoothie. 
            Some powder supplements contain a flow agent (such as magnesium stearate, silicon dioxide, 
            or rice husks) to prevent ingredient clumping.
